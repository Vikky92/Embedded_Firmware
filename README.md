Embedded Systems and device driver code

AP0200 is a Linux device driver for Aptina Image Signal Processor AP0200. 

This used I2C for command interfacing and V4l2 for video data handling over the Camera Sensor Interface(CSI) port on the Nitrogen6x_max evaluation board.

This board was booted up with a custom made Embedded Linux build.
